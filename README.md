## **Changes made**
- Modification of colorful assets with pop out effect
- New carousel game view
- Some changes to layout and formatting

## **Configuration Options**

- This theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE
  
- `Theme Variant` - sets the theme variant adjusting the gamelist view. Each variant comes in a Colorful or Monochrome version which changes the theme coloring based on the system colors or a gray shade.
   - `List`
   - `Carousel`
   - `List (video)`

 - `Theme Color Scheme` - sets the theme color scheme adjusting the background image color. 
   - `Light`
   - `Dark`
   - `Black`
     
- `Font Size` - enables you to change the size of the fonts displayed in the theme.
   - `Small`
   - `Medium`
   - `Large`
     
- `Theme Aspect Ratio` - sets the aspect ratio the theme will render at. If needed, this can be changed to match the aspect ratio of your screen (though it should happen automatically).
   - `16:9`
   - `16:10`
   - `4:3`
   - `1:1`
   - `3:2`
   - `5:4`
   - `19.5:9`
   - `21:9`

## **To-Do**
- [x] Update remaining system pop images (complete)
- [x] Add gamelist game video variant using Colorful hardware assets
  - [x] Update remaining game video positioning and overlays (complete)
  - [ ] Make a better default fallback image
- [x] Review changing size of colorful block to match max image size based on aspect ratio (e.g. game cartridges etc get cut off for some aspect ratios but the block extends)  
- [ ] Add hacks systems
- [ ] Implement theme customization options
